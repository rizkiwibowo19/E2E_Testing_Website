This project is an end-to-end (E2E) testing suite for a website using Cypress. The goal of these tests is to ensure that various features on the website function correctly according to predefined user scenarios.

This testing suite includes five test cases:

1.  Responsive Testing
    This test verifies the website's display when accessed through different devices: desktop, tablet, and smartphone.

2.  Login and Logout Testing
    This test checks the functionality of the login and logout features. It includes the following stages: login with valid credentials, login with an incorrect username,          login with an incorrect password, login with case-sensitive username, and login with case-sensitive password.

3.  Login with Multiple Tasks
    Similar to the second test case, this one verifies the login process using valid credentials, incorrect username, incorrect password, case-sensitive username, and case-        sensitive password. The difference lies in the code steps implemented for this test.

4.  Registering a New Account
    This test ensures that the registration feature works properly by creating a new account and validating it with assertions.

5.  Add Product to Cart and Checkout
    This test evaluates the functionality of adding a product to the shopping cart and testing the checkout process from the cart.
